However, the capability of such systems in detecting new or unseen botnets is crucial to ensure its robustness against the rapid evolution of botnets. Moreover, it prolongs the effectiveness of the system in detecting bots, avoiding frequent and time-consuming classifier re-training. We present BOTection, a privacy-preserving bot detection system that models the bot network flow behavior as a Markov Chain. Using the state transitions extracted from the Markov chains, we train a classifier to first detect network flows produced by bots, and then identify their bot families. BOTection is content-agnostic and resilient to encryption, relying on high-level network features to model bots’ network behavior. We evaluate our system on a dataset of over 7M malicious flows from 12 botnet families, showing its capability of detecting bots’ network traffic with 99.78% F-measure. Notably, due to the modeling of general bot network behavior, BOTection can detect traffic belonging to unseen bot families that launch similar attacks to those previously known with an F-measure of 93.03%. We also assess BOTection robustness in classifying a bot family with a 99.09% F-measure score, which is essential in understanding their behavior for effective detection.","tags":["Network traffic analysis","Sequence analysis","Markov chain","Botnet","Malware","Detection"],"title":"BOTection: Bot Detection by Building Markov Chain Models of Bots Network Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michal Piskozub","Riccardo Spolaor","Ivan Martinovic."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1576133509,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575429048,"objectID":"be012d38800c261dda9f552b39fe10ad","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/compactflow-conf/","publishdate":"2019-12-02T14:51:49+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/compactflow-conf/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Network flows","Binary format"],"title":"CompactFlow: A Hybrid Binary Format for Network Flow Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Merylin Monaro","Riccardo Spolaor","QianQian Li","Mauro Conti","Luciano Gamberini","Giuseppe Sartori"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1574923666,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575429048,"objectID":"3b4c06fabca015d8f93f5f18418c008e","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/type-me-the-truth/","publishdate":"2019-11-28T14:47:46+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/type-me-the-truth/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a novel method, based on keystroke dynamics, to distinguish between fake and truthful personal information written via a computer keyboard.

Nevertheless, the emerging malware variants and zero-day exploits keep posing significant challenges to malware detection systems.

Specifically, DART trains the adaptive classifier by simultaneously optimizing three factors: (i) the structural risk functions; (ii) the joint distribution between the known malware and unseen malware variants domains; and (iii) the manifold consistency underlying marginal distribution. In addition, DART also works with encrypted network traffic since it does not leverage information related to the packet content. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal with a thorough set of experiments.

While not long time ago users were seeking constant Internet connection (e.g., via free Wi-Fi hotspot), now they also look for energy sources to recharge their smartphones' battery, due to the use of more energy-draining apps (e.g., Pokémon Go).\nThis phenomenon has led to the diffusion of free charging stations in public places and the marketing of portable batteries a.k.a. powerbanks. Despite the preventive measures implemented by Android's developers in order to prevent data transfer via USB cable (i.e., 'Charging only' mode), we are able to exploit a hidden communication channel which leverages only the electrical current provided for charging the smartphone.\nOn one side, a malicious app (which can be disguised as a legitimate, clean app) installed on the victim's phone, which only requires wakelock permission (i.e., to wake up the phone when it is idle), remains silent until the device is plugged to a USB port and left unattended. Then, such app begins transmitting sensitive data coded in energy consumption peaks. On the other side, the energy provider (e.g., powerbank) is able to measure such peaks and then reconstruct the transmitted information. All this happens without the malicious app's access to Internet or other permissions, except for the information that it wants to exfiltrate.","tags":["Applied Security","Mobile"],"title":" No Free Charge Theorem 2.0: How to Steal Private Information from a Mobile Device Using a Powerbank","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Merylin Monaro","Marta Businaro","Riccardo Spolaor","Qian Qian Li","Mauro Conti","Luciano Gamberini","Giuseppe Sartori"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1542523794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575437247,"objectID":"88c601fbabfdfeb765ecea66d53af576","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/online-identity-detection/","publishdate":"2018-11-18T14:49:54+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/online-identity-detection/","section":"publication","summary":"Around 50% of the world population is now active on internet, often subscribing websites, social networks or other online services.

Starting from a previous study, this paper investigates the possibility to detect faked identities recording keystroke dynamics, while the user is filling an online subscription form with personal – real or faked, information. Cognitively overloading liars through few unexpected questions, we demonstrated that it is possible to recognize the deceivers with an accuracy of 85%. To automatically detect liars, three machine-learning classifiers were trained on 40 liars and 40 truth-tellers, and tested on 10 unseen liars and 10 truth-tellers.

Users continuously carry such devices with them and use them for daily communication activities and social network interactions. Hence, such devices contain a huge amount of private and sensitive information. For this reason, mobile devices become popular targets of attacks. In most attack settings, the adversary aims to take local or remote control of a device to access user sensitive information. However, such violations are not easy to carry out since they need to leverage a vulnerability of the system or a careless user (i.e., install a malware app from an unreliable source). A different approach that does not have these shortcomings is the side-channels analysis. In fact, side-channels are physical phenomenon that can be measured from both inside or outside a device. They are mostly due to the user interaction with a mobile device, but also to the context in which the device is used, hence they can reveal sensitive user information such as identity and habits, environment, and operating system itself. Hence, this approach consists of inferring private information that is leaked by a mobile device through a side-channel. Besides, side-channel information is also extremely valuable to enforce security mechanisms such as user authentication, intrusion and information leaks detection.

Mobile devices can access and store personal information (e.g., location, photos, and messages) and thus are appealing to malware authors. One of the most promising approach to analyze malware is by monitoring its execution in a sandbox (i.e., via dynamic analysis). In particular, most malware sandboxing solutions for Android rely on an emulator, rather than a real device. This motivates malware authors to include runtime checks in order to detect whether the malware is running in a virtualized environment. In that case, the malicious app does not trigger the malicious payload. The presence of differences between real devices and Android emulators started an arms race between security researchers and malware authors, where the former want to hide these differences and the latter try to seek them out. In this paper we present Mirage, a malware sandbox architecture for Android focused on dynamic analysis evasion attacks. We designed the components of Mirage to be extensible via software modules, in order to build specific countermeasures against such attacks. To the best of our knowledge, Mirage is the first modular sandbox architecture that is robust against sandbox detection techniques. As a representative case study, we present a proof of concept implementation of Mirage with a module that tackles evasion attacks based on sensors API return values.","tags":["Android","Mobile device","Emulator","Sandbox","Dynamic analysis","Malware analysis","Hooking method"],"title":"Mirage: Toward a Stealthier and Modular Malware Analysis Sandbox for Android","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent F Taylor","Riccardo Spolaor","Mauro Conti","Ivan Martinovic"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1502261113,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575429048,"objectID":"94173a5da3757e897384c8f1659deff0","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/appscanner-journal/","publishdate":"2019-11-28T14:45:13+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/appscanner-journal/","section":"publication","summary":"The apps installed on a smartphone can revealmuch information about a user, such as their medical conditions,sexual orientation, or religious beliefs.

At the same time, thanks to the technological innovation and to the high user demands, those devices are integrating extensive functionalities and developers are writing battery-draining apps, which results in a surge of energy consumption of these devices. This scenario leads many people to often look for opportunities to charge their devices at public charging stations: the presence of such stations is already prominent around public areas such as hotels, shopping malls, airports, gyms and museums, and is expected to significantly grow in the future. While most of the time the power comes for free, there is no guarantee that the charging station is not maliciously controlled by an adversary, with the intention to exfiltrate data from the devices that are connected to it. In this paper, we illustrate for the first time how an adversary could leverage a maliciously controlled charging station to exfiltrate data from the smartphone via a USB charging cable (i.e., without using the data transfer functionality), controlling a simple app running on the device—and without requiring any permission to be granted by the user to send data out of the device. We show the feasibility of the proposed attack through a prototype implementation in Android, which is able to send out potentially sensitive information, such as IMEI, contacts’ phone number, and pictures.","tags":["Systems security","Signal analysis","Malicious app","Permission","Operating system","Covert channel","Energy consumption","Mobile device","Android"],"title":"No Free Charge Theorem: A Covert Channel via USB Charging Cable on Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maddalena Favaretto","Riccardo Spolaor","Mauro Conti","Marco Ferrante"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1494485196,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575429048,"objectID":"1192f36ba33715b490ad81269cb423af","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/you-surf-so-strange-today/","publishdate":"2017-05-11T14:46:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/you-surf-so-strange-today/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, with the increasing number of attacks against user privacy in web services, researchers put a significant effort on realizing more and more sophisticated Intrusion Detection Systems in order to identify potentially malicious activities. Among such systems, Anomaly Detection Systems rely on a baseline given by a normal behavior and consider every deviation from such behavior as an intrusion.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Anomaly Detection System to detect intrusions in users’ private areas in on-line web services. Such services usually record logs of user activity from different points: access, actions in a session and system responses. We design an ad-hoc mathematical model for each of these logs to build a profile for a normal behavior. In particular, we model users’ accesses through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Users’ activity with a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC). We propose a novel Anomaly Detection System algorithm that takes into consideration the deviation from the above Markov Processes. Finally, we evaluate our proposal with a thorough set of experiments, which results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of our solution.","tags":["Web traffic","HTTP logs","Anomaly detection","Hidden Markov Model","Continuous Time Markov Chain","Apache logs"],"title":"You Surf so Strange Today: Anomaly Detection in Web Services via HMM and CTMC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riccardo Spolaor","Merylin Monaro","Pasquale Capuozzo","Marco Baesso","Mauro Conti","Luciano Gamberini","Giuseppe Sartori"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1493362032,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575429048,"objectID":"3bcc06f3ababa9bd57399bb64c8f22b6","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/you-are-how-you-play/","publishdate":"2017-04-28T14:47:12+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/you-are-how-you-play/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, user authentication on mobile devices is principally based on a secret (e.g., password, PIN), while recently two-factors authentication methods have been proposed to make more secure such secret-based methods. Two-factors authentication methods typically combine knowledge factors with user’s characteristics or possessions, obtaining high authentication performances. In this paper, we propose a novel two-factors authentication method based on users’ cognitive skills. Cognitive abilities are caught through the users’ performance to small games, which replicated the classical attentional paradigms of cognitive psychology. In particular, we introduced three games that rely on selective attention, attentional switch and Stroop effect. While users were solving a game on their smartphones, we collected cognitive performance (in terms of accuracy and reaction times), touch features (interactions with touch screen), and sensors features (data from accelerometer and gyroscope). Results show that our cognitive-based games can be used as a two-factors authentication mechanism on smartphones. Relying on touch and sensors features as behavior biometrics, we are able to achieve an authentication accuracy of 97%, with a Equal Error Rate of 1.37%.","tags":["Authentication","Screen unlock","Android","Mobile device","Cognitive game","Usability"],"title":"You are how you play: Authenticating mobile users via game playing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riccardo Spolaor","QianQian Li","Merylin Monaro","Mauro Conti","Luciano Gamberini","Giuseppe Sartori"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1480574815,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575429048,"objectID":"acde9bd0bc27e339b26e4d76d63be852","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/biometric-auth-survey/","publishdate":"2016-12-28T14:46:55+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/biometric-auth-survey/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, users are starting to develop a symbiotic bound with their smartphones.

Since smartphones handle a huge amount of private information, recent techniques rely on those sensing capabilities to authenticate the user, measuring her biometric features.

In this paper, we propose CAPTCHaStar, a new image-based CAPTCHA that relies on user interaction. This novel CAPTCHA leverages the innate human ability to recognize shapes in a confused environment. We assess the effectiveness of our proposal for the two key aspects for CAPTCHAs, i.e., usability, and resiliency to automated attacks. In particular, we evaluated the usability, carrying out a thorough user study, and we tested the resiliency of our proposal against several types of automated attacks: traditional ones; designed ad-hoc for our proposal; and based on machine learning. Compared to the state of the art, our proposal is more user friendly (e.g., only some 35% of the users prefer current solutions, such as text-based CAPTCHAs) and more resilient to automated attacks.

IoT sensors can monitor a wide range of environmental features such as the energy consumption inside a building at fine-grained level (e.g., for a specific wall-socket). Some smart buildings already deploy energy monitoring in order to optimize the energy use for good purposes (e.g., to save money, to reduce pollution). Unfortunately, such measurements raise a significant amount of privacy concerns. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of recognizing the pair laptop-user (i.e., a user using her own laptop) from the energy traces produced by her laptop. We design MTPlug, a framework that achieves this goal relying on supervised machine learning techniques as pattern recognition in multivariate time series. We present a comprehensive implementation of this system and run a thorough set of experiments. In particular, we collected data by monitoring the energy consumption of two groups of laptop users, some office employees and some intruders, for a total of 27 people. We show that our system is able to build an energy profile for a laptop user with accuracy above 80%, in less than 3.5 hours of laptop usage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that assesses the feasibility of laptop users profiling relying uniquely on fine-grained energy traces collected using wall-socket smart meters.

In fact, the list of apps installed on a device can be used to identify vulnerable apps for an attacker to exploit, uncover a victim’s use of sensitive apps, assist network planning, and aid marketing. However, app fingerprinting is complicated by the vast number of apps available for download, the wide range of devices they may be installed on, and the use of payload encryption protocols such as HTTPS/TLS. In this paper, we present a novel methodology and a framework implementing it, called AppScanner, for the automatic fingerprinting and real-time identification of Android apps from their encrypted network traffic. To build app fingerprints, we run apps automatically on a physical device to collect their network traces. We apply various processing strategies to these network traces before extracting the features that are used to train our supervised learning algorithms. Our fingerprint generation methodology is highly scalable and does not rely on inspecting packet payloads; thus our framework works even when HTTPS/TLS is employed. We built and deployed this lightweight framework and ran a thorough set of experiments to assess its performance. We automatically profiled 110 of the most popular apps in the Google Play Store and were later able to re-identify them with more than 99% accuracy.","tags":["Network traffic analysis","Security","Privacy","Android","Mobile device","Classification"],"title":"Appscanner: Automatic fingerprinting of smartphone apps from encrypted network traffic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valeriu-Daniel Stanciu","Riccardo Spolaor","Mauro Conti","Cristiano Giuffrida"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1457505886,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575429048,"objectID":"7ee71284f36a2ed562f9df46fe217541","permalink":"http://www.spolaor.com/publication/on-the-effectiveness-of-sensor-enhanced/","publishdate":"2016-03-09T14:44:46+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/on-the-effectiveness-of-sensor-enhanced/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, simple password-based authentication systems have increasingly proven ineffective for many classes of real-world devices. As a result, many researchers have concentrated their efforts on the design of new biometric authentication systems. This trend has been further accelerated by the advent of mobile devices, which offer numerous sensors and capabilities to implement a variety of mobile biometric authentication systems. Along with the advances in biometric authentication, however, attacks have also become much more sophisticated and many biometric techniques have ultimately proven inadequate in face of advanced attackers in practice. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of sensor-enhanced keystroke dynamics, a recent mobile biometric authentication mechanism that combines a particularly rich set of features. In our analysis, we consider different types of attacks, with a focus on advanced attacks that draw from general population statistics. Such attacks have already been proven effective in drastically reducing the accuracy of many state-of-the-art biometric authentication systems. We implemented a statistical attack against sensor-enhanced keystroke dynamics and evaluated its impact on detection accuracy.

The fact that the network traffic is often encrypted makes the attack even more challenging.
